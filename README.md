**WELCOME TO JIMMY HAY'S APP STYLE UX EXPERIMENT**

---

This idea behind this experiment is to create a web based app that has a similar behaviour to a device application where by you navigate the application using swipes instead of with the scrollbar. The idea of hi-jacking the natural scroll behaviour of the browser is somewhat controversial, however, in certain circumstances these interactions are desired.

You can see the final implementation by going to the following url:
